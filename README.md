- 👋 Hi, I’m @mattyjed16
- 👀 I’m interested in a complete career change and moving into the developer world but currently I am a complete beginner.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning with The Odin Project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything with people in a similar position to myself who have just started and want someone to work with on this journey.
- 📫 How to reach me, my Discord server name is Matty E and happy to chat on there.
